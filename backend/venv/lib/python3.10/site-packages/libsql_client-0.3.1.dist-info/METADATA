# Python SDK for libSQL

**[API reference][reference] | [Github][github] | [PyPI][pypi]**

[reference]: https://libsql.org/libsql-client-py/reference.html
[github]: https://github.com/libsql/libsql-client-py
[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/libsql-client/

This is the source repository of the Python SDK for libSQL. You can either connect to a local SQLite database or to a remote libSQL server ([sqld][sqld]).

> **_NOTE:_**  If you want to use libSQL with SQLAlchemy, you should check out the [libSQL dialect](https://github.com/libsql/sqlalchemy-libsql).

[sqld]: https://github.com/libsql/sqld

## Installation

```
pip install libsql-client
```

## Getting Started

Connecting to a local SQLite database:

```python
import asyncio
import libsql_client

async def main():
    url = "file:local.db"
    async with libsql_client.create_client(url) as client:
        result_set = await client.execute("SELECT * from users")
        print(len(result_set.rows), "rows")
        for row in result_set.rows:
            print(row)

asyncio.run(main())
```

To connect to a remote libSQL server ([sqld][sqld]), just change the URL:

```python
url = "ws://localhost:8080"
```

## Supported URLs

The client can connect to the database using different methods depending on the scheme (protocol) of the passed URL:

* `file:` connects to a local SQLite database (using the builtin `sqlite3` package)
  * `file:/absolute/path` or `file:///absolute/path` is an absolute path on local filesystem
  * `file:relative/path` is a relative path on local filesystem
  * (`file://path` is not a valid URL)
* `ws:` or `wss:` connect to sqld using WebSockets (the Hrana protocol).
* `http:` or `https:` connect to sqld using HTTP. The `transaction()` API is not available in this case.
* `libsql:` is equivalent to `wss:`.

## Synchronous API

This package also provides a synchronous version of the client, which can be created by calling `create_client_sync()`. It supports the same methods as the default `asyncio` client, except that they block the calling thread:

```python
import libsql_client

url = "file:local.db"
with libsql_client.create_client_sync(url) as client:
    result_set = client.execute("SELECT * from users")
    print(len(result_set.rows), "rows")
    for row in result_set.rows:
        print(row)
```

The synchronous client is just a thin wrapper around the asynchronous client, but it runs the event loop in a background thread.
